Add the following routes to your config/routes.rb file:

    map.resource :invitation, :only => [:new, :create]
    map.signup   '/signup/:invite_code', :controller => 'users', :action => 'new'

Add to your User model:

    acts_as_inviteable
    
Be sure to run rake db:migrate.
If you want to you may want to change the default invitation limit first in the migration file.
